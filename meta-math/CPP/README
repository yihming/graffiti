I. Configure ANTLR3
---------------------
1. cd /usr/local/lib
2. wget http://www.antlr3.org/download/antlr-3.5-complete.jar
3. Open "~/.bashrc" file, add the following lines at the bottom:
	export CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/antlr-3.5-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH
4. Save the file, and restart the terminal.


II. Build and Run the Project
----------------------
1. Run 'make';
2. Type the following command to run the program:
	java MetaMath <your file name>
3. After running the program, there will be one DOT file denoting the AST structure of the source C++ program, and one C++ file with ".output.cpp" extension denoting the modified C++ program due to the in-code markup commands;
4. Type the following command to generate PNG graph of the AST structure:
	dot -Tpng -o <target file name> <your DOT file name>


III. Source Files
---------------------
CPP.g: ANTLR3 grammar of C++ language (I modified the one in the ANTLR3 grammar list);
CPPGen.g: ANTLR3 Tree grammar file, which is used to manipulate and modify the C++ Abstract Syntax Trees;
CPP.stg: the String Template for C++ language, used as the code generating phase;
MetaMath.java: Top-level Java program for the project.
