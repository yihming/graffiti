I. Description: 

    This is a Matlab source code processor written in Haskell. The features hitherto are:

a) Parse a subset of Matlab syntax into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). The test case is in Test/heat.m;

b) Use GraphViz to visualize the generated AST. The sample is Test/heat.m.dot and Test/heat.png.


II. Installation:

  1. make sure that you have both Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) and Haskell Cabal (a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs) installed on your system.

  2. Use cabal to install "GraphViz" package (notice: not necessarily to use sudo):

                 cabal install graphviz

  3. run "make".


III. How to Use:

  The executable file "MetaMath" generated in II is the main program to run. You just need to add one option -- source file name. For instance,

                ./MetaMath Test/heat.m

then the DOT file indicating its AST structure will be generated in Test. To emit the PNG result, you can use the following command:

                dot -Tpng -o heat.png heat.m.dot

Now you have the visualized AST picture.
