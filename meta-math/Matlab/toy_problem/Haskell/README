Software Requirement:

1. The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) Version > 7.4

2. Install cabal. For example, on Ubuntu, type the following command:
               sudo apt-get install cabal-install
   and on Fedora, type the following command:
               sudo yum install cabal-install

3. Type the following command to install Dimensional and NumType libraries (no need to use sudo command):
               cabal install dimensional numtype


How to play:

1. Type "make" command in the current directory to get source code compiled by GHC compiler.

2. Type
                   ./heat

to run the executable file.

3. You can refer HeatConduction.hs file for the details in Haskell implementation.
